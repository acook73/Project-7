# COSC 307 Final project

## Lila's Quest

### Special libraries needed to build/compile if personal machines were used
Nothing necessary to compile, just run the executible provided in the github for your operating system: there is one for both Windows and Linux.

### Instructions on how to build/compile your program
download the zip file for your operating system from the github, afterwards extract the archive and run the .exe or the .x86_64 file to play!

### User manual with how the controls/interactions work
  
         Known bugs. If you document what you know is wrong, and these are minor issues, we will not take off for them. Examples include weird behavior, image mismatches, other last minute issues. If you document more serious issues (seg faults on conclusion, program crashing, etc.) we will give more partial credit.
         Any other information that will inform the instructor and TAs for final grading. If there is special equipment, e.g., NES controllers or a special library, weâ€™ll make an appointment for the demo during exam week
