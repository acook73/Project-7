# COSC 307 Final project

## Lila's Quest

### Special libraries needed to build/compile if personal machines were used
Nothing necessary to compile, just run the executible provided in the github for your operating system: there is one for both Windows and Linux.

### Instructions on how to build/compile your program
Download the zip file for your operating system from the github, afterwards extract the archive and run the .exe or the .x86_64 file to play!

### User manual with how the controls/interactions work
The game has a tutorial to teach you the controls, however, here is them listed anyways :)

#### Controls:
a and d to move left and right on the screen respectively      
space bar to jump / doublejump      
shift to dash         
s to crouch      
left click to side attack      
w + left click to up attack     
s + left click (on ground) to crouch attack      
s + left click (in air) to down attack     
right click to grapple      
esc to pause     

#### interactions
Player can use the movement options explained above to traverse the level while gathering upgrades and fighting enemies. The player will make their way to the final boss, and upon defeating it, they will beat the game.

### Known bugs. If you document what you know is wrong, and these are minor issues, we will not take off for them. Examples include weird behavior, image mismatches, other last minute issues. If you document more serious issues (seg faults on conclusion, program crashing, etc.) we will give more partial credit.
Pause menu displays incorrectly during the boss battle due to a camera limit.

### Any other information that will inform the instructor and TAs for final grading. If there is special equipment, e.g., NES controllers or a special library, weâ€™ll make an appointment for the demo during exam week
The github commit history and distribution is not entirely accurate as a second branch used to exist but has since been deleted to consolidate everything into main.
